# react-portfolio

For this assignment I created a new portfolio that utilized the new skills I have acquired through React. For this assignment I took the liberty to explore new platforms and libraries to see what they were like. I started using the Bootstrap React library for the header. I imported the Nav and Navbar components so that I could use them as frameworks for the header. I also added some of my own styling so that it would stay at the top of the screen. For the footer I used the `window.innerWidth` command so that I could get the current width of the window. This allowed me to make a variable, triangular footer with contact information fixed to the bottom corner. 
I implemented these components by wrapping the pages with them on the App.js page. This made sure that those pages would include both componenets. For the about and projects pages, I designed pages that I thought would be mobile responsive, as well as fashionable. The displayed the information to the viewers in a user friendly manner, and helped to inform the viewer about my talents. Below is a video of the working application:
